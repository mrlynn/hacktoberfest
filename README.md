# Welcome to the MongoDB Hacktoberfest wiki!

## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software. Started originally by our friends at [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com)

## How is MongoDB Participating?
This year, we're celebrating open source software by hosting a challenge for software developers. Innovation and developer of freely available software is an essential part of our ecosystem. This is why we're incenting developers to create interesting projects leveraging [MongoDB Stitch](http://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch) and export the apps for storage on a [GitHub](http://github.com) repository.

## How can you participate?
Simply create an app and leverage [MongoDB Stitch](http://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch) as part of the app. Export the source code for the app using the handy export capability from within Stitch. Then, create a README.md file for your project that leverages a [MongoDB Stitch App Badge](./badges.md). Similar to these:
